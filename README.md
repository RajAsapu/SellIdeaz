# SellMyIdeaz
A software platform to sell the ideas of the comman man

  There are 2 kinds of users – Consumers and Producers
    	Consumers : They are the people who consume the ideas for an application/restaurant or any thing. ( like myApp).
    	Producers : They are the people who create the ideas and keep for sale . ( like customer of myApp).

    For example , assuming there is a restaurant who serves Chinese food and they would like to grow they will create a contest saying that all the good ideas which are submitted today receive $5 of gift card. People will submit ideas and the restaurant can consume those. It would be similar to feedback , but the difference is that it allows all the users to sell their ideas to their applications , store owners or restaurants.
